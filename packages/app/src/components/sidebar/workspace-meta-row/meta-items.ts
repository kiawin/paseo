 * What ends up on the line under a workspace title, in the order it is read: how many agents are
 * working in it, where the workspace lives, what change it belongs to, whether that change is
 * passing, what it is running, and what someone filed it under.
 *
 * The agent count leads, ahead of identity. Every other item describes the workspace — where it
 * is, which change it carries, how that change is doing. The count is the only one about live
 * work, and it is the reason you would open the row at all, so it is read first.
 *
 * Labels are one item rather than one per label: they are drawn as a run of chips with a single
 * separator in front of them, so the line reads as four peers however many labels a workspace
 * carries.
